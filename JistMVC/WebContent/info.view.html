                for the war efforts, and helped develop new imaging technologies in a research unit. After the military she
                went into the healthcare industry as a radiologic technologist. Technology is the connecting facet between all

                 relied upon. She is now finishing a 19-week full stack Java web development bootcamp at Skill Distillery, with hopes
                 of an innovative career development.</p>
